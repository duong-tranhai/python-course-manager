# Course Manager Backend (FastAPI)

This project is the backend system for a full-featured Course Manager application, built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL.

It supports student enrollment, lesson and quiz management, attendance tracking, progress monitoring, and role-based access control for students, teachers, and administrators.

# Requirements
Python 3.10 or higher
(Recommended: Python 3.10.x or 3.11.x for FastAPI and Pydantic v2 compatibility)

PostgreSQL 13 or higher
